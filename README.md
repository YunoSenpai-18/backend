## Laravel Setup Instructions

This guide will walk you through setting up a local development environment for a Laravel project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### 1. **Download Laravel Herd**

- Download [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/windows)

### 2. **Install DBngin**

- Download and install [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/), a MySQL management tool for local development.

### 3. **Install TablePlus**

- Download and install [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/download/), a MySQL database management tool.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: 
    - Clone the repository using:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YunoSenpai-18/backend.git
    cd your-laravel-app
    ```
    - Alternatively, you can download the ZIP and unzip it in your desired directory.

2. **Install Project Dependencies**: Run the following command to install the necessary PHP dependencies using Composer:
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Copy the `.env` file**: Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Edit the `.env` File**: Open the `.env` file and change the `SESSION_DRIVER` and `APP_URL` (if using localtunnel) configuration:
    ```plaintext
    SESSION_DRIVER=file
    ```

    ```plaintext
    APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1
    ```

5. **Generate Application Key**: Generate the application key:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6. **Run Database Migrations**: Set up the database by running the migrations:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

7. **Seed the Database**: Seed the database:
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed --class=UserSeeder
    ```

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed --class=BuildingSeeder
    ```

    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed --class=RoomSeeder
    ```

8. **Create Storage Symbolic Link**: Create a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public` for photos:
    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

8. **Start MySQL Database**: Open DBngin and click the Plus (+) button to create a MySQL instance. Choose MySQL as the database, then click **Create**.

9. **Configure TablePlus**: Open TablePlus and configure your local MySQL connection:
    - **Name**: localhost
    - **Host/IP**: 127.0.0.1
    - **Port**: 3306
    - **User**: root
    - **Password**: (leave blank or as per your setup)
    Click **Save** to establish the connection.

10. **Configure Laravel Herd**: Open Laravel Herd and make sure all services are running (green status). Under **General**, add the path to folder with the project inside.

11. **Expose your Local Server**: Open Laravel Herd and access the Expose option.
    - Create an **Expose** account and obtain your Expose token from [Expose](https://expose.dev/).
    - Use the following command to share your local Laravel app over the internet:
    ```bash
    expose share http://backend-main.test
    ```
    - Copy the **public URL** provided by Expose.

12. **Test Accessibility**: Make sure the URL is accessible in a web browser. It should look something like this: `https://your-expose-url.expose.dev`.

13. **Connect with React Native**: Open your React Native app and paste the **Expose public URL** into the backend configuration or API URL setting to establish a connection between the frontend and backend for testing.

14. **Alternative to Expose Share (If Expose Share Didn't Work)**: 
    If the `expose share` command didnâ€™t work for you, you can use **localtunnel** as an alternative to expose your local server:
    - Install **localtunnel** globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g localtunnel
    ```

    - Start your Laravel development server in one CMD window:
    ```bash
    php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
    ```

    - Expose the server with **localtunnel** in the second CMD window: 
    ```bash
    lt --port 8000 --subdomain testingapi
    ```

    - Copy the **public URL** provided by localtunnel and use it in your React Native configuration to connect the frontend to the backend.
